#Expedia-Task

Built the website to filter the results according to what the client need, for example:

If the user searched for the city, the data sent will be everything related to this city.

#Back-end:
Built using NodeJs for better performance in addition to ExpressJs.

#Front-end:
Built using AngularJs considering user interface (designing was simple because of the short time).

#Challenges:
-My laptop was broke, so I took more time to re-install all the programs again.

-For the front end (since it needs more time for better designing) I had some issues for fetching data, but the data sent from the back-end is correct
